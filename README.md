## Overview

I recently started to use Python and Pandas for data analysis, with a goal of moving toward ML eventually. In the meantime, this repository is for a mini project. The goal of this project is to summarize some data from StackOverflow developer surveys. Specifically, I am curious about what trends exist, if any, in how developers respond to these questions from the survey:

1 - "How is your organization thinking about or implementing blockcahin technology?"
2 - "Blockchain / cryptocurrency technology is primarily:"

To start, I don't yet know how many years back these questions go. I know they were asked in the 2019 stack overflow survey. This should require me to do some data filtering and manipulation to generate some potential insights into how devs think about "blockchain technology" - a world often indistinguishable from hype.
