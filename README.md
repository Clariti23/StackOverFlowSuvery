## Overview

I recently started to use Python and Pandas for data analysis, with a goal of moving toward ML eventually. In the meantime, this repository is for a mini project. The goal of this project is to summarize some data from StackOverflow developer surveys.

1 - "How is your organization thinking about or implementing blockcahin technology?"
2 - "Blockchain / cryptocurrency technology is primarily:"

This should require some data filtering, manipulation, and visualization to generate some potential insights into how devs are thinking about "blockchain technology" - a phrase often indistinguishable from hype.
